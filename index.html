                example: "Imagine a time traveler named Alex who goes back to 1920 and accidentally prevents their grandfather from meeting their grandmother. As a result, Alex might never be born."

                fact: "The Bootstrap Paradox",
                description: "Also known as the Ontological Paradox, it involves an object or information sent back in time, becoming the cause of itself in the future, creating a loop with no clear origin.",
                example: "A scientist receives a book from their future self, learns from it, and later travels back in time to give the book to their past self."

                fact: "The Predestination Paradox",
                description: "This paradox occurs when a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that predestines them to travel back in time, ensuring the events that led to the time travel occur.",
                example: "A person travels back in time to save someone, only to realize their actions were the cause of the event they were trying to prevent."

                description: "Proposed by physicist Igor Novikov, it suggests that any actions taken by a time traveler were always part of history, thus avoiding paradoxes by ensuring consistency.",
                example: "A time traveler goes back to witness a historical event and realizes their presence was always part of the event."

                fact: "The Parallel Universes Theory",
                description: "This theory suggests that time travel might create alternate timelines or parallel universes, where changes in the past do not affect the original timeline.",
                example: "A traveler changes an event in the past, creating a new timeline, while the original timeline remains unchanged."

                example: "A time traveler steps on a butterfly in the past, leading to drastic changes in the present."

                fact: "The Time Loop Paradox",
                description: "Occurs when a sequence of events repeats itself in a loop, potentially trapping the time traveler in a never-ending cycle.",
                example: "A person relives the same day repeatedly, with each iteration starting over at the same point in time."

                fact: "The Temporal Paradox",
